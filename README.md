# re-learning-JS

Hello!
My name is Juan, and since this year 2023, I decided to learn how to be a developer. I changed my entire carreer to this gold.

Just finishing my first bootcamp as a "Full Stack Web Developer", using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL and Node.JS and React frameworks.
And it was awesome! But I feel that I need much more to play a good role in the industry, so I am reading the book "JavaScript for impatient programmers" recomended by my friend "Manuel Cuesta".

In this repository, I will upload everything I learn from this book, as well as a review of old things I already knew.
